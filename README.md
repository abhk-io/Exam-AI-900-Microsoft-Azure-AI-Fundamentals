Study Guide &amp; Notes | AtulKamble

1. Schedule [Exam AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ai-900)

Candidates for this exam should have foundational knowledge of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) concepts and related Microsoft Azure services.
This exam is an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of common ML and AI workloads and how to implement them on Azure.
This exam is intended for candidates with both technical and non-technical backgrounds. Data science and software engineering experience are not required; however, some general programming knowledge or experience would be beneficial.
Azure AI Fundamentals can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based certifications like Azure Data Scientist Associate or Azure AI Engineer Associate, but itâ€™s not a prerequisite for any of them.
